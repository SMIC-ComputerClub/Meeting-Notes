Things we are doing in shark fiesta
1. VR (oculus rift, or mobile vrs)   
- people will play game in vr after paying money, if they reach a certain highscore they will get a prize
- Plan now is oculus rift with Mr. Garry's computer, but if we can't do that we will use Percy's mobile VR case or Gear VR with Chris's phone.
2. Selling VR cardboard
- We will sell VR cardboard to people
3. Pinball machine
- A pinball machine.

Everyone must come up with their own project/ group project within next two weeks.

More details for Shark Fiesta will be discussed in the Wechat Group.
