Meeting summary:

1. Everyone should go to hourofcode.com and look for a project that would interest the middle schoolers. 
   Choose one by next Friday.
2. Ppl should check if they can attend the Hackathon with their parents.
3. Update the repos weekly from now on- that means, for this week everyone needs to update their project repo 
    before next Friday. If your repo is not updated for 2 weeks, the rule is that you will be kicked out from the club. 
    If you still donâ€™t have a repo for your project, make sure to make one.
