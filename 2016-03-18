Dear Computer Club members,

Last Friday, we discussed our fundraising scheme. In order to raise money for our projects, especially the umbrella machine, we will be allowing people to try out Mr. Garry's Oculus Rift at a rate of 5 RMB for the first minute and 3 RMB for each subsequent minute. People that are interested will be able to pay us and sign up a day before. For security purposes, the Oculus Rift and the computer will remain in the C302 computer lab.

On Monday, Mr. Garry will show the ropes to anyone who has time after school. This is the tentative schedule for shifts. Basically, shifts will alternate between the A-week group and the B-week group. Next week will (hopefully) be our first A-week. Chris, Max, Kailas, Percy, and Sean, who were absent last week, have been assigned randomly. If you have any scheduling conflicts, please tell me before this Friday.

If you haven't created a Github account yet, please do so; people involved with the umbrella project should create a repository on Github.

Sorry for sending this late, as I was really busy preparing for TEDxSMICSchool the last few days.

By the way, if you were absent from the meeting on March 4 or March 11, please tell me ASAP.

Excused: Chris, Max, Kailas, Percy, Sean

Best,
Wesley
