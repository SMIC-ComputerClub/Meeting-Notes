Dear Computer Club members,

On the meeting last Friday, we first discussed the drone project. It seemed impossible to sustain due to the lack of resources and equipment, and no one wanted to continue it; as such, we decided to move on to fixing and improving the Aquashield Project (umbrella machine). For people that are interested in software, we may also have a Java-based project. Anyhow, we will continue discussing this the following week.

If you have any other ideas for projects, please bring them up to the co-presidents!

Unexcused absences: Albert, Ryan, Henry (please provide an excuse, thanks)

Best regards,
Wesley Ding
